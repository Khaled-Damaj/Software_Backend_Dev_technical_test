              Question 1: What command(s) can we use to find the distribution of
              the system installed on the server?

            <p>
              Running <strong>lsb_release -a</strong> will show the distribution
              name, version and release number. Another way to find the
              distribution of a Linux system is to use the
              <strong>cat /etc/*-release</strong> command, this command will
              show the version, release and codename of the distribution. In
              addition to <strong>Hostnamectl</strong> and
              <strong>cat /proc/version</strong>. The image below depict the
              explained commands

              Question 2: Explain the permissions of the folder located in

            <p>
              Each file and directory has three types of permissions: read,
              write, and execute. These permissions are represented by the
              letters "r", "w", and "x", respectively. The permissions for a
              folder are usually represented as a string of characters, which is
              divided into three groups of three characters, each group
              representing the permissions for the owner of the file, the group
              owner of the file, and others.
              <br />
              The folder of <strong>/tmp/exercise_1</strong> has permissions
              <strong>"drwxr-sr--"</strong> , d means that is a directory,the
              <strong>"rwx"</strong> it means that the owner of the folder has
              read, write, and execute permissions,the
              <strong>"r-s"</strong> means that the group owner of the folder
              has read and has the ability to execute the file or access the
              directory as if it were a file, and <strong>"r--"</strong> means
              all other users have only read permissions.

              save the content of the file. It will be used later.

              The api_key was found the <strong>/data/.secret_folder</strong> ,
              in order to know we use the command cat to display the content of
              the README in the <strong>/tmp/exercise_3/README.md</strong> ,the
              content was actually the location of the api_key.

              First we ne need to export the query results to a CSV file, then
              using a data visualization tool to create the chart for example we
              can use python script for example using Matplotlib.
